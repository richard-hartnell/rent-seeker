A hype machine for the [dissolving equity land trust](https://www.dissolvingequity.org)

## This is a Reddit bot that I programmed on a lark that will trawl some very popular subs and look for discussions, especially pertaining to common myths and misperceptions, about rent and the housing crisis.

#### When finding hits, it prompts to leave some stock comments, add a custom comment, upvote/downvote, or to permanently ignore the comment (which the bot will also do in the future if I've already commented).
