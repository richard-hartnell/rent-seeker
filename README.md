# clown-bot
Correcting the record on clowns.

## This is a Reddit bot that I programmed on a lark that will trawl some very popular subs and look for commenters using the word "clown" as an insult.

#### If it finds someone using the word "clown" in a comment, it prompts me to leave a stock comment, which is a copy of a highly-upvoted comment I once left on my main account.

#### The prompt also allows me to skip commenting or to permanently ignore the comment (which the bot will also do in the future if I've already commented).

#### Here is the comment the bot leaves if prompted:

Hi! Circus performer here. Just dipping in to clear up this too-frequent comparison between clowns and stupid people:
1. Clowns are very diligent and work very hard at refining their art.
2. Clowns are generally very kind and well-intentioned people.
3. Clowns are only *pretending* they are completely stupid.

For a clownish rabbit hole, please enjoy this play written by Dario Fo, the only clown to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqKfwC70YZI
